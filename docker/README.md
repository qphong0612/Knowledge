# Docker 
## What's Containers?
- Standardized, portable packaging for ur applications.
- A container is a standard unit of sofware that packages up code and all its dependencies so the applications runs quickly and reliable from one computing environment to another.
- Bundles an application's code together with the related configuration files and libraries, and with dependencies required for the app to run.
- The problem of an application failing to run correctly arise due to differences in configuration underlying library requirement and other denpendencies. Containers address this problem by providing a lightweight, immutable infrasttructure for application packaging and deployment.
