# ETIP: An Enriched Threat Intelligence Platform for improving OSINT correlation, analysis, visualization and sharing capabilities

## Abstract 
`Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)` data is collected by publicly available sources to be used by intelligence contexts among which `Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) are the main consumers`. These platforms help organizations aggregate, correlate, and analyze threat data from multiple sources in real-time to support defensive actions. However, considering the unstructured nature of the collected data, TIPs require the data to be correlated with real-time information coming from the monitored infrastructure, before being analyzed and shared. This paper presents ETIP, an Enriched Threat Intelligence Platform with extended capabilities in terms of import, quality assessment processes, visualization and information sharing in current TIPs. The platform receives structured cyber threat information from multiple sources and performs the correlation among them with static and dynamic data coming from external sources and the monitored infrastructure. This allows the evaluation of a threat score through heuristic-based analysis, used to enrich the information received from OSINT and other sources. The final result is sent to external entities, such as SIEMs, to be further used for a more in-depth analysis, and to be shared with trusted organizations.

## Context 
- The number and impact of cyber attacks have drastically increased during the last years, especially in terms of how much these threats could harm them from an economic point of view.
- These successful incursions potentially allow groups of attackers to acquire valuable intellectual properties and secrets. With the aim of facing these menaces to protect precious internal and sensitive data as well as critical assets, it is crucial to have timely access to relevant and accurate information about them.
- Collecting and processing Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) information is becoming a fundamental approach for obtaining cybersecurity threat awareness.
- Recently, the research community has demonstrated that useful information and Indicators of Compromise (IoC) can be obtained from OSINT.
- Research studies have provided evidence that useful and early information can be obtained from social networks e.g., Twitter. Twitter is a useful OSINT data source that aggregates timely data from multiple sources which is simple to process and analyze. 
- Besides the research oriented efforts, all Security Operation Centre (SOC) analysts get updated about new threats against their IT infras- tructures by collecting and analyzing cybersecurity OSINT data. Never- theless, skimming through various news feeds is a time-consuming task for any security analyst.
- of the information carried on OSINT to SOC analysts, for instance, to benefit from the potential they have. In addition, such tools must filter only the relevant parts for the SOC analysts, thus decreasing the amount of information and consequently, the time required to analyze it and act upon. When appropriate, the filtered information must be further processed to extract IoCs.
- Moreover, a proper quality assessment is needed, to check if gathered data can be considered as valuable Threat Intelligence (denoted as TI)
- Identified TI quality evaluation as one of the main challenges in actual cybersecurity information sharing scenarios, mainly caused by the limitation of existing TI sharing tools, as well as the lack of suitable and globally recognized standards and ontologies [10]. These assessment processes can provide more insights for inferring the impact that some cyber-attacks could have with respect to internal assets and resources, prioritizing threat detection and incident response.
- Both, original and enriched data are shared with trusted external parties, improving collaborations among different organizations (that may belong to different sectors e.g., finance, health, energy, public administration)
